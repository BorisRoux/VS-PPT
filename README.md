# Quick Notes
If you are here for the Structure visualizer in the map mode scroll for Visual Studio 2022 extension, the .vsix download link is [here](https://github.com/BorisRoux/VS-PPT/releases/download/v2022.0/Microsoft.VisualStudio.PowerTools.StructureVisualizer.vsix)

# History

Structure visualizer in the map mode scroll bar was part of Visual Studio Power Tools prior 2017.

For some reasons, Microsoft did not port it to VS2017 and further.

Thanks to Jonathan, this add-in has been upgraded so we could use it with VS2017 and VS2019. All credits go to him, I simply forked his repo and upgraded the extension for VS2022 (which simply means make it build on my machine and test it).

Below links are Jonathan's add-ins for previous Visual Studio versions.

# Disclaimer

This port only focuses on Structure Visualizer. Other parts of Power Tools have been ignored (they probably don't even build), anyway Microsoft is still taking care of them.

This has been tested for VS2022 and C# only. VB.net should work though, I didn't touch the core functionalities of the add-in.

PowerTools are still a great bunch of add-ins, I recommend you give them a look to make the most of Visual Studio :)
